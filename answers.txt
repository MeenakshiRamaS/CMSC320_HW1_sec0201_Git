Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is one of the most used version control systems in the
world. It allows people to collaborate on code, debug and share
code, and track the repository history seamlessly. From the perspective
of this class, we can use Git to collaborate on our
group projects this semester!

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to all fields in existence
because most fields heavily depend on user or customer data. For
instance, the healthcare industry uses data science to analyze patient
data to track new diseases, family history, create cures, and more.
The finance industry also uses data science to analyze market data and
provide its users with the most recent information.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging combines the histories of both the branches we are
merging. However, rebasing formulates a linear branch history in
that it moves the history of one branch on top of another. This shows
the history of both branches more clearly!

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I am taking some very interested courses this semester,
including CMSC320! I have never taken any courses related to data
science so I am eager to learn more about this topic! I am also
taking an introductory finance course this semester as part of my minor.
This class has been really interesting so far, so I am really excited
to see where it goes!!
